My Sketch

![Culture](sketch1.png?raw=true "Culture") 

This is my sketch depicting images of my home, Monument Valley, and aspects of my tribal nation. There are four Navajo baskets on each corner of the canvas, and the Navajo Nation seal in the middle. The background changes color with the movements of the mouse which in many ways can resemble a changing environment. Though the environment changes with movement, the aspects of culture and home remain constant. Written at the top of the page I have written "Yá'át'ééh",the Navajo word for "hello". Also written is "Nizhónígo Nee Ado’ááł", which translates to, "have a good day". The protections and preservation of my Indigenouse language, culture, and ancestral lands is important to me and it is what I hoped to depict in my sketch.
